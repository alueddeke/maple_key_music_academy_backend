# Maple Key Music Academy Backend

A Django REST API backend for a music school management system with role-based authentication, lesson scheduling, and invoicing.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

- **Unified User Model** - Single model supporting Management, Teachers, and Students
- **Role-Based Permissions** - Different access levels for different user types
- **Mixed Authentication** - OAuth (Google) + JWT token authentication
- **Dual Invoicing System** - Teacher payments and student billing
- **Lesson Management** - Scheduling, confirmation, and completion workflow

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Virtual environment
- Google OAuth credentials (for OAuth login)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd maple_key_music_academy_backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start development server
python manage.py runserver
```

## 👥 User Types & Roles

### Management

- **Full system access** - Can view and manage all data
- **Auto-approved** - No approval required
- **Admin privileges** - Django admin access
- **Invoice approval** - Can approve teacher payment invoices

### Teachers

- **Lesson management** - Can create, confirm, and complete lessons
- **Student management** - Can manage their own students
- **Invoice creation** - Can submit monthly lesson invoices
- **Approval required** - Must be approved by management

### Students

- **Lesson requests** - Can request lessons from teachers
- **Own data access** - Can view their own lessons and invoices
- **Approval required** - Must be approved by management

## 🔐 Authentication System

### JWT Token Authentication

```bash
# Login
POST /api/auth/token/
{
    "email": "teacher@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
}
```

### Google OAuth

```bash
# Initiate OAuth
GET /api/auth/google/
```

## 📚 Key API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/token/` - Get JWT tokens
- `POST /api/auth/token/refresh/` - Refresh access token
- `GET /api/auth/google/` - Initiate Google OAuth
- `GET /api/auth/user/` - Get current user profile

### Lesson Management

- `GET /api/billing/lessons/` - List lessons
- `POST /api/billing/lessons/request/` - Student requests lesson
- `POST /api/billing/lessons/{id}/confirm/` - Teacher confirms lesson

### Invoice Management

- `POST /api/billing/invoices/teacher/submit-lessons/` - **Submit lesson details and create invoice**
- `POST /api/billing/invoices/teacher/{id}/approve/` - Approve invoice

## 💰 Invoicing Workflows

### Teacher Payment Flow

1. Teacher completes lessons throughout the month
2. Teacher submits monthly form with lesson details
3. System creates lessons and invoice automatically
4. Invoice status: pending (awaiting management approval)
5. Management approves invoice
6. School processes payment to teacher

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Architecture Tests

```bash
python test_architecture.py
```

**Tests include:**

- ✅ User creation with different roles
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ Role-based permissions
- ✅ Lesson workflow
- ✅ Invoice system
- ✅ Error handling

## 🏛️ Architecture Decision Records

Backend architectural decisions are documented in [ADRs](./docs/adr/README.md).

**Key Backend Decisions:**
- [BE-0001: Unified User Model](./docs/adr/BE-0001-unified-user-model.md) - Single table with user_type field
- [BE-0002: Email-Based Authentication](./docs/adr/BE-0002-email-based-authentication.md) - USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
- [BE-0003: Dual-Purpose Invoice Model](./docs/adr/BE-0003-dual-purpose-invoice-model.md) - One model for both invoice types
- [BE-0004: Dual-Rate Lesson Pricing](./docs/adr/BE-0004-dual-rate-lesson-pricing.md) - Rate locking at lesson creation
- [BE-0005: JWT Token Authentication](./docs/adr/BE-0005-jwt-token-authentication.md) - Stateless API authentication
- [BE-0006: OAuth with Django Allauth](./docs/adr/BE-0006-oauth-with-django-allauth.md) - Google OAuth integration
- [BE-0007: Pre-Push Migration Hook](./docs/adr/BE-0007-pre-push-migration-hook.md) - Prevent migration conflicts
- [BE-0008: Student Billing Contact Design](./docs/adr/BE-0008-student-billing-contact-design.md) - Current implementation

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Student billing invoices (pre-payment system)
- Payment processing integration
- Email notifications
- Calendar integration
- Video call integration
- Mobile app support
- Advanced analytics
